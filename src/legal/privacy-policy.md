- **Structured Changeovers:** Supervised handovers where direct contact between parents is not appropriate, managed calmly and efficiently.
- **Virtual Support:** Online supervision for families where in-person services are not suitable.
- **Observation and Documentation:** Clear, factual observation records prepared after each service for use in family law proceedings.

We operate as a mobile service across Metropolitan Melbourne, meeting families in agreed public locations.
