## 2. About Our Services

Family Bond Australia provides child contact services for families navigating separation and family law proceedings across Metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Our services include:

### 2.1 Supported Contact (Supervised Visits)

A trained supervisor is present throughout visits to ensure they run smoothly while allowing natural interaction between parents and children. Our supervisors are warm, approachable, and experienced in creating relaxed environments.

### 2.2 Structured Changeovers

Supervised handovers where direct contact between parents is not appropriate. The supervisor manages timing, communication, and the exchange, helping children move between parents in a predictable and supported way.

### 2.3 Virtual Support

Online supervision for families where in-person services are not suitable. Sessions are conducted online with oversight provided throughout.

### 2.4 Observation and Documentation

Clear, factual observation records prepared after each service. These may be shared with legal representatives or used to support ongoing family law arrangements.

### 2.5 Additional Services

We may also provide, upon request and as separately quoted:

- Home safety checks
- Affidavits
- Subpoena responses
- Court appearances
